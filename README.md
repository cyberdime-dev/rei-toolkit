## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### **Modern Vue 3 Architecture**
```javascript
// Example: Composition API with TypeScript-ready patterns
<script setup>
import { ref, computed, watch, onMounted } from 'vue'

const formData = ref({
  purchasePrice: 0,
  downPayment: 0,
  monthlyRent: 0
})

const calculatedMetrics = computed(() => {
  // Safe calculation logic with error handling
  return {
    cashFlow: calculateCashFlow(formData.value),
    capRate: calculateCapRate(formData.value),
    cashOnCashReturn: calculateCOCReturn(formData.value)
  }
})
</script>
```

### **Secure Financial Calculations**
```javascript
// Replaced unsafe eval() with secure expression parser
const evaluateExpression = expression => {
  const tokens = expression.match(/[0-9.]+|[+\-*/]/g) || []
  // Safe arithmetic evaluation without code injection risks
  return processTokens(tokens)
}
```

### **Component-Based Architecture**
- **Modular Design**: Each calculator is self-contained with its own logic
- **Reusable Components**: Shared UI elements across the application
- **Props & Emits**: Clean parent-child component communication
- **Slot-Based Layouts**: Flexible content composition patterns

## 🎯 Development Approach

### **Test-Driven Development**

- **Component Tests**: UI interaction and state management verification
- **Integration Tests**: Router navigation and component integration
- **E2E Tests**: Complete user workflows and business logic validation

### **Performance Optimization**
- **Code Splitting**: Route-based lazy loading for faster initial loads
- **Bundle Analysis**: Webpack bundle analyzer for size optimization
- **Image Optimization**: Responsive images and modern formats
- **Caching Strategies**: Service worker implementation for offline capability

### **Security Implementation**
- **Input Validation**: Sanitization of all user inputs
- **XSS Prevention**: Safe HTML rendering and content escaping
- **Dependency Auditing**: Regular security updates and vulnerability scanning
- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers for production deployment
