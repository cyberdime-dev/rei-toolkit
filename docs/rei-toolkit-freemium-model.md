**Free (Local)**

* All calculators (Buy & Hold, Fix & Flip, BRRR, NOI, Cap Rate, etc.).
* Local deal storage with import/export (CSV/PDF).
* Dark/light theme, responsive UI.
* No login required.
  *(This matches your current positioning: Vue + Vuetify app with local persistence and exports.)* ([GitHub][1])

**Pro (Solo) — \$19–\$29/mo or \$149/yr**

* **Cloud sync** (multi-device backup & restore).
* **Shareable, branded reports** (hosted links + custom logo/colors).
* **Online templates & checklists** (due-diligence library, auto-updates).
* **Zapier/Make + Sheets/Airtable** export.
* **Basic data credits** (e.g., 200/month) for comps/metadata pulls.

**Team — \$49–\$79/mo + \$15/extra seat**

* **Real-time collaboration** (assign deals, comments, audit log).
* **Shared pipeline/Kanban** + team metrics (offers sent, win rate, avg spread).
* **Role-based permissions** (acq mgr, dispo, partner).
* **Client/Buyer portals** (read-only deal pages).

**Add-ons (usage-based)**

* Extra **property/owner/comp lookups** (bundle credits, then \$X/100 overage).
* **Bulk import** & data cleaning for lists.
* **AI report writer** (executive summary, risk flags, offer letter draft).

> Rule of thumb: expect \~3–7% free→paid conversion if the **online** features directly save time or make money (e.g., comps, collaboration, buyer share links). Anchor with annual pricing and include credits to showcase value fast.

## What should count as “online benefits”

Prioritize what’s **impossible or painful offline**:

1. **Data & enrichment**

* Comps & ARV helpers; rent estimates; school/crime/amenity overlays.
* Owner/LLC contact enrichment; USPS validation; parcel/lot data.
* Market/rate/tax updates by county (auto-maintained in cloud).

2. **Collaboration & selling**

* Shareable links to buyer lists; one-click NDA/Co-wholesale agreement; versioned updates.
* Comments/mentions on deals; tasks with due dates; status automations.

3. **Automation**

* Pipelines: New → Underwriting → Offers → Under Contract → Dispo.
* Triggers: send offer PDF, notify team, update buyer portal, log to CRM.

4. **Hosted assets**

* Branded PDFs (no “watermark” on paid).
* Media storage (photos, rehab bids, inspection notes).

## Pricing & growth mechanics

* **Fast paywall moment:** Put a “Share online” / “Get comps” button in the free flow; let them preview the feature, then require Pro to publish or pull data.
* **Credits included** in Pro so users try data on day 1.
* **Team value**: seat-based pricing plus shared pipeline is your ARPU expansion.
* **Annual discount** (2 months free) + **Founders/Lifetime** for first 100 customers to seed testimonials.
* **In-product trials**: 7 days or 14 data credits—no credit card—then soft lock with upgrade CTA.

---

## Technical & product notes (so this model actually works)

* **Entitlements & gating:** Use Firebase Auth + Firestore to issue feature flags/plan entitlements. Local mode requires no auth; cloud features check entitlements server-side. (Your repo already includes Firebase configs—lean into that.) ([GitHub][1])
* **Data vendors:** Start with 1–2 reliable sources (e.g., county tax + a comps API). Ship *good enough* ARV, then refine. Keep variable cost behind credits.
* **Exports:** Free = CSV/PDF with subtle “Generated by REI Toolkit” footer; Paid = remove branding, custom logo/colors, vanity domain.
* **Telemetry (opt-in):** Track only plan-critical events (created deal, clicked “Share,” requested comps). Respect privacy; publish a short policy.
* **Performance:** Keep all **calculations local** for speed and trust; make cloud optional so the free promise remains true.

---

## Licensing & risk

Your code is public. If you want to keep “free local” but protect the business:

* **Dual license**: Open-source core (AGPL or similar) + commercial license for hosted/brand assets; or use a **source-available** license (e.g., BSL/Polyform) for specific modules (report templates, data connectors, brand assets).
* **Trademarks**: Protect the name/logo; allow forks for personal use, restrict using your brand for commercial distribution.
* **API keys server-side**: Never ship vendor keys in client; proxy calls through your backend and meter usage.

*(This isn’t legal advice—run final licensing through counsel.)*

## Go-to-market in 30 days

**Week 1:** Ship Pro with 1 killer cloud feature (Shareable reports) + 200 data credits.
**Week 2:** Record 3 Looms: (a) Analyze a deal in 5 min, (b) Create ARV report, (c) Share with buyers.
**Week 3:** Post 3 LinkedIn carousels with before/after deal math; offer **free ARV report** for first 50 DMs.
**Week 4:** Email sequence to waitlist: case study → feature → offer (annual 20% off). Add in-app upsell nudge at “Share” and “Get comps.”
