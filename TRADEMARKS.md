# REI Toolkit Trademarks and Brand Usage

The names "REI Toolkit", "Cyberdime", the REI Toolkit logo, and related brand assets are trademarks of Cyberdime (the "Trademarks").

This policy describes permitted and prohibited uses of the Trademarks. It applies to all forms of use, including in source code, binaries, websites, marketing materials, and derivative works.

## Allowed Uses (with attribution)

- Truthful references to REI Toolkit to describe compatibility, interoperability, or factual statements (e.g., "Built with REI Toolkit"), provided you include attribution and do not imply sponsorship or endorsement.
- Educational or news commentary about REI Toolkit.
- Open-source forks that clearly rename the application and remove confusing branding, while retaining an attribution notice in documentation.

## Prohibited Uses

- Using the name "REI Toolkit" or the official logo in a way that suggests official affiliation, sponsorship, or endorsement without written permission.
- Using the Trademarks in the name of your product, service, company, or domain (e.g., "rei-toolkit-pro.com") without written permission.
- Using official branding, logos, or confusingly similar marks in commercial forks or competing SaaS products.
- Modifying the Trademarks or creating confusingly similar marks.

## Naming for Forks and Distributions

- Community forks must use names and logos that are clearly distinct from "REI Toolkit" and must include a statement such as: "This is an independent community build not affiliated with Cyberdime or the REI Toolkit project."
- You may state factual compatibility (e.g., "Compatible with the REI Toolkit file format").

## Logos and Visual Assets

All logos and visual brand assets are copyrighted works and may not be used without written permission, except as specifically permitted above. Do not use the official logo in your application UI without permission.

## Attribution

When referring to REI Toolkit, include this attribution where appropriate:

"REI Toolkit is a project by Cyberdime. 'REI Toolkit' and the REI Toolkit logo are trademarks of Cyberdime."
